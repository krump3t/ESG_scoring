Executive Summary

Microsoft is committed to becoming carbon negative, water positive, and zero waste by 2030.

Climate and Energy:
We have committed to Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi) validated targets to reduce our Scope 1, 2, and 3 emissions by more than half by 2030 compared to our 2020 baseline. We aim to achieve net-zero emissions across our value chain by 2050.

In fiscal year 2023, our total carbon emissions were 13.9 million metric tons of CO2e, representing a 6.3% reduction from the previous year. Our Scope 1 and 2 emissions decreased by 7.8% year-over-year.

We have contracted for more than 19.8 gigawatts of renewable energy globally through power purchase agreements (PPAs), making us one of the largest corporate purchasers of renewable energy worldwide.

Water Stewardship:
Our goal is to be water positive by 2030, replenishing more water than we consume. In FY23, we replenished approximately 1.3 million cubic meters of water through watershed restoration projects.

Waste Reduction:
We are committed to achieving zero waste across our direct operations, products, and packaging by 2030. In FY23, we achieved a 78% waste diversion rate from landfills, recycling or composting the majority of our operational waste.

Ecosystems:
By 2025, we will protect more land than we use, helping to conserve biodiversity and build climate resilience. We have protected and permanently conserved over 15,000 acres to date through partnerships with conservation organizations.

Governance and Disclosure:
We report our environmental performance through CDP Climate Change and Water Security questionnaires and align with Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD) recommendations. Our sustainability work is overseen by our board of directors.""",

Our Climate Target
Shell aims to become a net-zero emissions energy business by 2050, in step with society's progress in achieving the goal of the Paris Agreement on climate change.

We have set a target to reduce the net carbon intensity of the energy products we sell by 50% by 2050, compared with 2016 levels, with a near-term target of 20% reduction by 2030.

Performance
In 2023, our total Scope 1 and 2 CO2 emissions were approximately 55 million tonnes, a reduction of 5% compared to 2022. Our Scope 3 emissions from the use of energy products sold to customers were estimated at 1,230 million tonnes of CO2 equivalent.

Net Carbon Intensity
Our net carbon intensity in 2023 was 74.1 gCO2e/MJ, representing a 4.8% reduction from our 2016 baseline of 77.9 gCO2e/MJ. We are on track to meet our 2030 target.

Renewable Energy
We invested $3.5 billion in low and zero-carbon energy solutions in 2023, including wind, solar, hydrogen, and biofuels. Our installed renewable generation capacity reached 4.1 gigawatts.

Energy Efficiency
We continue to improve the energy efficiency of our operations. In 2023, we achieved energy savings of approximately 2.8 petajoules through efficiency projects at our refineries and chemical plants.

Framework Alignment
Our sustainability reporting aligns with the recommendations of the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD), Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) Standards, and Sustainability Accounting Standards Board (SASB) metrics for the oil and gas sector.

We are actively engaged with the Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi) and have set targets consistent with limiting global warming to well below 2Â°C.""",

    "exxonmobil_2023": """ExxonMobil 2023 Sustainability Report

Climate Strategy
ExxonMobil is committed to achieving net-zero Scope 1 and 2 greenhouse gas emissions from our operated assets by 2050. We have announced plans to reduce the greenhouse gas intensity of our upstream operations by 20-30% by 2030, compared with 2016 levels.

Emissions Performance
In 2023, our total Scope 1 and 2 emissions were approximately 116 million tonnes CO2 equivalent. We reduced flaring by 50% compared to 2016 levels and methane intensity by more than 30% over the same period.

We have established near-term emission-reduction plans for major operated assets that are expected to achieve reductions consistent with our 2030 greenhouse gas intensity goals.

Low-Carbon Solutions
We are advancing a portfolio of lower-emission technologies, including carbon capture and storage, hydrogen production, and biofuels. In 2023, we announced plans to invest more than $17 billion through 2027 in lower-emission initiatives.

Carbon Capture and Storage
We are the world leader in carbon capture with an equity share of about one-fifth of global carbon capture capacity. We captured approximately 9 million tonnes of CO2 in 2023.

Methane Management
We have implemented comprehensive methane detection and repair programs across our operations. Our methane intensity for our upstream oil and gas operations was 0.15% in 2023, well below the industry average.

Reporting and Disclosure
Our reporting is informed by the recommendations of the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD) and aligns with the Sustainability Accounting Standards Board (SASB) standards for the oil and gas sector. We publish an annual Energy & Carbon Summary providing detailed information on our climate-related risks and opportunities."""
