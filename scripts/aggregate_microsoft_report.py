"""
Aggregate Full Microsoft 2023 Report Scoring

Demonstrates how rubric v3.0 scores would be aggregated across an entire
sustainability report to produce a final company-level maturity assessment.

This script:
1. Loads multiple findings from Microsoft 2023 report
2. Scores each finding with rubric v3.0
3. Aggregates dimension scores across findings
4. Produces final company-level maturity (predicted vs MSCI AAA / CDP A-)
