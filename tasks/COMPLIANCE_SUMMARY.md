## Summary of Remediation Actions

**Initial Validation Results**:
- Compliant: 2/7 tasks (Tasks 001, 002)
- Non-Compliant: 5/7 tasks (Tasks 003-007)

**Issues Found**:
- Tasks 003-007 missing >= 3 P1 sources in evidence.json
- Tasks 003-007 missing success criteria in design.md
- Tasks 005-007 missing required sections in hypothesis.md
- Task 004 missing provenance field in data_sources.json
- Task 006 had unicode encoding issue

**Remediation Completed**:
- Added missing P1 sources (18 total sources added across tasks 003-007)
- Enhanced all design.md files with verification plans and success criteria
- Rewrote hypothesis.md for tasks 005-007 with all required sections
- Fixed data_sources.json schema compliance
- Replaced all unicode characters (>=, +/-) with ASCII equivalents

**Final Validation Results**:
- Compliant: 7/7 tasks (100%)
- Non-Compliant: 0/7 tasks
- All 63 validation checks passed (9 checks x 7 tasks)

## Next Steps

With all tasks validated and compliant, the migration is ready to proceed:

1. **Begin Task 001 Execution**:
   ```bash
   cd tasks/001-mcp-iceberg-infrastructure
   python ../../sca_infrastructure/runner.py --phase context
   ```

2. **Context Gate Validation**: Verify all context files are valid before proceeding to Phase 1

3. **Sequential Execution**: Execute phases 1-5 for each task in order:
   - Task 001: Infrastructure setup
   - Task 002: Bronze landing
   - Task 003: Iceberg core
   - Task 004: QA & Explainability
   - Task 005: Ops & Freshness
   - Task 006: Cutover & Migration
   - Task 007: Hardening & Optimization

4. **Gate Enforcement**: All 14 gates must pass at each phase:
   - workspace, context, tdd, coverage_cp (>= 95%)
   - types_cp (mypy --strict), complexity (CCN <= 10)
   - docs_cp (>= 95%), security, hygiene
   - authenticity_ast, performance, fuzz
   - data_integrity, traceability

5. **Snapshot Save**: After each successful phase, save snapshot with:
   ```bash
   python ../../sca_infrastructure/runner.py --snapshot
   ```
