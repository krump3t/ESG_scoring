# AV-001: Authenticity Audit Remediation — Executive Summary

**Generated**: 2025-10-26
**Protocol**: SCA v13.8-MEA
**Status**: 🔴 **203 violations (34 FATAL)** — Ready for Remediation
**Timeline**: 3 days (14-22 hours)
**Complexity**: Medium-High

---

## What Happened?

The ESG evaluation pipeline passed internal quality gates but failed a deep authenticity audit. The audit (run 2025-10-26 using canonical SCA tool) identified **203 systematic violations** across the codebase:

```
Total Violations: 203
├─ Priority 0 (FATAL):      34  ⚠️  BLOCKS EVERYTHING
├─ Priority 1 (Determinism): 87  ⚠️  REGULATORY RISK
├─ Priority 2 (Evidence):    29  ⚠️  COMPLIANCE RISK
├─ Priority 3 (Posture):     12  ⚠️  PRODUCTION RISK
└─ Priority 4 (Errors):      74  ⚠️  ROBUSTNESS RISK
```

**Root Causes**:
1. Code contains `eval()` and `exec()` calls (34 instances) — security anti-pattern
2. Random number generation unseeded (87 instances) — breaks reproducibility
3. Evidence retrieval not validated against rubric (29 instances) — compliance gap
4. Error handling incomplete (74 instances) — silent failures
5. Docker deployment assumes network access (12 instances) — production mismatch

---

## Why This Matters

### Regulatory Impact
- **SEC Disclosure Rules**: ESG claims must be traceable to source documents
- **Scoring Reproducibility**: Auditors can demand "prove this score again" — must get same answer
- **Artifact Integrity**: All computational steps must be verifiable and deterministic

### Business Impact
- **Timeline**: Extended without remediation (audit blocks release)
- **Trust**: Customers question scoring methodology if violations known
- **Compliance**: Liability exposure if non-deterministic scoring leads to disputes

### Technical Impact
- **Maintainability**: eval/exec makes code impossible to analyze statically
- **Testing**: Non-determinism makes test results unreliable
- **Scaling**: Can't deploy with confidence without reproducibility guarantees

---

## The Solution: 6-Phase Remediation

This package provides everything needed to fix all 203 violations systematically.

### Phase Overview

```
Day 1 (7-12 hours):
  Phase 1: FATAL          [████████        ] 4-7h   Remove 34 eval/exec
  Phase 2: Determinism    [████████        ] 3-5h   Seed all randomness

Day 2 (7-10 hours):
  Phase 3: Evidence       [█████████       ] 4-6h   Enforce parity + rubric
  Phase 4: Posture        [███████         ] 3-4h   Fix error handling

Day 3 (3-6 hours):
  Phase 5: Errors         [██              ] 2-3h   Add comprehensive logging
  Phase 6: Verification   [██              ] 2-3h   Test + audit + sign-off
```

**Total**: 18-28.5 hours across 3 days

---

## Quick Start (5 Minutes)

### 1. Understand the Scope
Read this summary (you're doing it now). Key insight: 6 sequential phases, highest-risk first.

### 2. Create Git Baseline
```bash
cd prospecting-engine
git tag -a audit-baseline-20251026 -m "Pre-remediation snapshot"
# This tag is your emergency rollback point
```

### 3. Open the Daily Checklist
```bash
cat QUICK_START_CHECKLIST.md | less
# Daily tasks with checkboxes
```

### 4. Start Phase 1
```bash
# Find first FATAL violation
grep -rn "eval(" scripts/ agents/ apps/ --include="*.py" | head -1
# Use REMEDIATION_PLAN.md Phase 1.1 for code example
```

### 5. End of Day
```bash
# Commit your work
git add -A
git commit -m "fix(AV-001-F001): Remove eval() in crawler.py"

# Update ISSUE_TRACKER.md with progress
# Update QUICK_START_CHECKLIST.md with completed items
```

---

## Critical Path

**You MUST follow this exact order:**

```
✅ Phase 1 MUST complete (0 eval/exec)
   ↓ (all tests pass)
✅ Phase 2 MUST follow Phase 1 (determinism enabled)
   ↓ (3x identical runs)
✅ Phase 3 MUST follow Phase 2 (parity validated)
   ↓ (evidence subset checks)
✅ Phase 4 MUST follow Phase 3 (posture hardened)
   ↓ (error handling complete)
✅ Phase 5 MUST follow Phase 4 (errors caught)
   ↓ (logging comprehensive)
✅ Phase 6 MUST follow Phase 5 (final gates pass)
   ↓ (all 203 violations = 0)
🚀 COMPLETE — Ready for production
```

---

## Success Criteria

### By End of Phase 6, Verify:

```
Gate 1 (FATAL):         0 eval() or exec() calls found
Gate 2 (Determinism):   3x identical runs produce byte-identical outputs
Gate 3 (Evidence):      All evidence ⊆ retrieval results (parity)
Gate 4 (Posture):       Type safety (mypy --strict = 0 errors)
Gate 5 (Errors):        All exceptions caught & logged
Gate 6 (Final):         Audit = 0 violations, all tests pass
```

**Commands to verify:**
```bash
# Phase 1: No eval/exec
grep -r "eval\|exec" scripts/ agents/ apps/ libs/ --include="*.py"
# Expected: 0 results

# Phase 2: Determinism
bash /tmp/test_det.sh
# Expected: 3 hashes identical

# Phase 3: Parity
python scripts/qa/verify_parity.py
# Expected: PASS

# Phase 6: All gates
python scripts/qa/authenticity_audit.py
# Expected: 0 violations

# All tests
pytest tests/ --cov
# Expected: 523/523 pass, ≥95% coverage
```

## Key Principles

### 1. Follow Phases in Exact Order
Don't skip ahead. Phase 1 unblocks Phase 2, etc.

### 2. Test After Every Change
Run `pytest tests/ --cov` after each file modification. Catches regressions early.

### 3. Commit Frequently with Issue IDs
Every commit: `git commit -m "fix(AV-001-F001): Description"`

### 4. Update Tracking Daily
QUICK_START_CHECKLIST.md and ISSUE_TRACKER.md reflect real progress. Helps morale.

### 5. Use Rollback If Needed
If a phase breaks tests: `git reset --hard audit-baseline-20251026` and start phase over.

## Risks & Mitigations

| Risk | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|--------|-----------|
| Phase 1 fixes break functionality | CRITICAL | Each fix has test case; full suite run after each |
| Determinism not achievable | HIGH | Clock + SEED infrastructure (Task 019) already working |
| Parity/Rubric over-constrains | MEDIUM | Test with real ESG data; AR-001 gates proven |
| New code has no tests | MEDIUM | Add failure-path tests; coverage ≥95% |
| Phase time estimate wrong | MEDIUM | Day 3 afternoon buffer (3-6h) available |

## Before You Start

### Verify These are True:

- [ ] **Baseline tag created**: `git tag audit-baseline-20251026` exists
- [ ] **All tests passing**: `pytest tests/ --cov` = 523/523 pass
- [ ] **Audit baseline captured**: `python scripts/qa/authenticity_audit.py` = 203 violations
- [ ] **You have 14-22 hours**: 3 days available for sustained focus
- [ ] **You've read this summary**: You're doing it now ✅

### If Any Are False:

- Missing baseline tag → Create it: `git tag -a audit-baseline-20251026 -m "Pre-remediation"`
- Tests failing → Fix them first (out of scope for AV-001)
- Audit not captured → Run: `python scripts/qa/authenticity_audit.py > artifacts/audit_baseline.json`
