# Executive Summary — Task 019: Authenticity Infrastructure

**Task ID**: 019-authenticity-infrastructure
**Status**: Context Complete (Awaiting Manual Review)
**Created**: 2025-10-26
**Protocol**: SCA v13.8-MEA

---

## Overview

Task 019 establishes determinism infrastructure and remediates all 149 authenticity violations identified in the comprehensive codebase audit. This foundational task unblocks all future work by ensuring full SCA v13.8 compliance.

---

## Objective

**Primary Claim**: Remediate 149 violations (9 FATAL, 140 WARN) → <11 documented exemptions with zero production FATAL violations.

**Deliverables**:
- `libs/utils/clock.py` - Deterministic time abstraction
- `libs/utils/determinism.py` - Seeded randomness utilities
- `libs/utils/http_client.py` - HTTP client abstraction for testability
- `.sca/exemptions.json` - Violation exemption registry (11 approved)

---

## Implementation Plan

**6 Phases over 3-week sprint (43 hours)**:

1. **Phase 1** (2h): Fix FATAL unseeded random in `apps/mcp_server/server.py:46`
2. **Phase 2** (16h): Implement Clock abstraction, rollout to 81 time violations
3. **Phase 3** (12h): Implement HTTP abstraction, rollout to 33 network violations
4. **Phase 4** (4h): Replace 10 silent exception handlers with explicit logging
5. **Phase 5** (6h): Migrate 16 data artifacts from JSON to Parquet
6. **Phase 6** (3h): Fix Task 018 coverage gap (94.4% → ≥95% branch)

---

## Success Criteria

- ✅ Authenticity audit: status="ok", 0 FATAL, ≤11 WARN (all documented)
- ✅ Determinism: 10 runs with SEED=42 produce identical SHA256 hash
- ✅ Network isolation: Zero live HTTP calls in test suite
- ✅ Coverage: ≥95% line & branch on infrastructure CP modules
- ✅ TDD compliance: All CP files have @pytest.mark.cp + Hypothesis + failure tests

---

## Risk Mitigation

**Top 3 Risks**:
1. Clock injection breaks existing tests → Gradual rollout (top 20 high-impact files first)
2. HTTP fixtures incomplete → One-time capture from live APIs
3. Timeline slips → Phase-by-phase gates allow early detection, buffer in Week 3

---

## Dependencies

**Upstream** (Complete):
- ✅ Authenticity Audit (AV-001) - 2025-10-26

**Downstream** (Blocked):
- Task 020+ - All future tasks benefit from determinism infrastructure
