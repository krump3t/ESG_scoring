## Schema Compatibility Fixes

### Problem
The pipeline had two different data schemas:
1. **PDF extraction** (LSE): Records with `text` field
2. **Pre-processed bronze/silver** (MSFT/AAPL/XOM/JPM): Records with `extract_30w` field

### Solution (4 code locations)

**File:** `apps/pipeline/demo_flow.py`

1. **Line 72 - BM25 Scoring:**
   ```python
   # Phase E: Support both 'text' (PDF extraction) and 'extract_30w' (pre-processed)
   texts = [record.get("text") or record.get("extract_30w", "") for record in bronze_records]
   ```

2. **Lines 100-104 - Semantic Embedding:**
   ```python
   # Phase E: Support both 'text' (PDF extraction) and 'extract_30w' (pre-processed)
   semantic_scores = {
       record["doc_id"]: _cosine_similarity(
           query_vec, embedder.embed(record.get("text") or record.get("extract_30w", ""))
       )
       for record in bronze_records
   }
   ```

3. **Lines 404-406 - Evidence Building:**
   ```python
   # Phase E: Support both 'text' (PDF extraction) and 'extract_30w' (pre-processed)
   text_content = str(doc.get("text") or doc.get("extract_30w", ""))
   snippets = _generate_snippets(text_content)
   ```

4. **Lines 498-503 - Theme Scoring:**
   ```python
   # Phase E: Support both 'text' (PDF extraction) and 'extract_30w' (pre-processed)
   text_content = str(doc.get("text") or doc.get("extract_30w", ""))
   finding = {
       "finding_text": text_content,
       "framework": str(doc.get("framework", "")),
   }
   ```

## Manifest Updates

**File:** `artifacts/demo/companies.json`

Changed LSE_HEAD_2025 layer from `"bronze"` → `"auto"`:

```json
{
  "company": "Headlam Group PLC",
  "year": 2025,
  "org_id": "LSE_HEAD",
  "doc_id": "LSE_HEAD_2025",
  "bronze": "data/raw/LSE_HEAD_2025.pdf",
  "pdf_path": "data/raw/LSE_HEAD_2025.pdf",
  "layer": "auto",  // ← Changed from "bronze"
  "source": "local_pdf",
  "sha256": "6a1dd9269c1cbba08802f0fa2d1d732d041dacd36113a6a02e36a563de85f8e5",
  "note": "PDF file - will use bronze tier (deterministic, no network)"
}
```

**Why `"auto"`?**
- With `RETRIEVAL_TIER=auto`, the pipeline tries silver first
- For LSE (no silver exists), it falls back to bronze (PDF extraction)
- PDF extraction is deterministic and doesn't need network, so it's safe for offline replay
- This allows other companies to use silver (faster) while LSE uses bronze (PDF)

## Evidence Gate Validation

### LSE_HEAD_2025 Evidence Audit ✅

All 7 themes pass with ≥2 distinct pages:

```json
{
  "all_themes_passed": true,
  "doc_id": "LSE_HEAD_2025",
  "themes": {
    "DM": {"evidence_count": 8, "pages": ["2", "3"], "unique_pages": 2, "passed": true},
    "EI": {"evidence_count": 8, "pages": ["2", "3"], "unique_pages": 2, "passed": true},
    "GHG": {"evidence_count": 8, "pages": ["2", "3"], "unique_pages": 2, "passed": true},
    "OSP": {"evidence_count": 8, "pages": ["2", "3"], "unique_pages": 2, "passed": true},
    "RD": {"evidence_count": 8, "pages": ["2", "3"], "unique_pages": 2, "passed": true},
    "RMM": {"evidence_count": 8, "pages": ["2", "3"], "unique_pages": 2, "passed": true},
    "TSP": {"evidence_count": 8, "pages": ["2", "3"], "unique_pages": 2, "passed": true}
  }
}
```

**Key Success:** Evidence extracted from **pages 2-3** of LSE_HEAD_2025.pdf with full page provenance tracking.

### MSFT Evidence Audit ⚠️

All 7 themes fail with only 1 distinct page:

```json
{
  "all_themes_passed": false,
  "doc_id": "msft_2023",
  "themes": {
    "DM": {"evidence_count": 13, "pages": ["1"], "unique_pages": 1, "passed": false},
    "EI": {"evidence_count": 13, "pages": ["1"], "unique_pages": 1, "passed": false},
    // ... all themes same: unique_pages=1
  }
}
```

**Root Cause:** Pre-processed bronze/silver data for MSFT has all records with `page_no=1` (stub/demo data). This is **expected for demo data** - real production data would have proper page numbers.

**Impact:** Evidence gate correctly rejects insufficient page diversity. This validates that the gate is working as intended.

---

## Critical Success Metrics

### ✅ What Worked

1. **LSE PDF Integration:** Full end-to-end PDF extraction with page tracking passes all gates
2. **Determinism:** 100% deterministic across 3 runs for all 5 documents
3. **Schema Compatibility:** Both PDF and pre-processed data schemas now supported
4. **Evidence Gate:** Correctly enforces ≥2 distinct pages requirement
5. **Offline Replay:** Strict offline mode works with auto tier (silver → bronze fallback)

### ⚠️ Known Limitation

**MSFT Evidence Gate Failure:** Demo/stub data has all `page_no=1`. This is **not a code issue** but an **input data issue**. The evidence gate is working correctly by rejecting this insufficient page diversity.

**Resolution:** Production data should have proper page numbers. If using pre-processed data, ensure bronze records have accurate `page_no` values from source documents.

---

## Deployment Readiness

### Production Configuration

```bash
export SEED=42
export PYTHONHASHSEED=0
export WX_OFFLINE_REPLAY=true
export ALLOW_NETWORK=""
export RETRIEVAL_TIER=auto  # Prefers silver, falls back to bronze for PDFs
export PYTHONPATH=.

python scripts/run_matrix.py --config configs/companies_local.yaml
```

### Evidence Gate Requirements

All documents must meet these criteria:
- **≥2 evidence quotes** per theme
- **≥2 distinct pages** per theme (evidence from at least 2 different pages)
- **Parity:** evidence_ids ⊆ fused_topk (evidence matches retrieval results)

### Data Quality Requirements

For pre-processed bronze/silver data:
1. Ensure `page_no` field contains accurate source page numbers (not all 1)
2. Alternative: Use `text` field instead of `extract_30w` for full-text processing
3. Validate page diversity before ingestion (≥2 pages per theme per document)

## Git Commits

1. **16db4a8** - "feat(phase-e): Complete PDF-to-evidence pipeline wiring with page tracking"
2. **b618873** - "docs(phase-e): Phase E completion report - 100% success"
3. **dc25fb0** - "fix(schema): Support both PDF extraction and pre-processed bronze/silver schemas"

---

## Files Modified

### Core Pipeline
- `apps/pipeline/demo_flow.py` (+20 lines, -6 deletions)
  - 4 locations now support both `text` and `extract_30w` fields
  - Maintains backward compatibility with both schemas

### Configuration
- `artifacts/demo/companies.json` (1 line changed)
  - LSE layer: `"bronze"` → `"auto"`

---

## Next Steps (Optional)

### P0 - Fix MSFT Data (if needed for production)
1. Regenerate bronze data for MSFT with proper page numbers
2. Or: Use full-text PDFs instead of extract_30w snippets
3. Validate page diversity: `SELECT theme, COUNT(DISTINCT page_no) FROM records GROUP BY theme`

### P1 - Standardize Field Names
1. Deprecate `extract_30w` in favor of `text` for all data sources
2. Update bronze_to_silver.py to normalize field names
3. Document canonical schema in data dictionary

### P2 - Enhanced Evidence Gate
1. Add theme-specific page requirements (e.g., GHG needs ≥3 pages)
2. Add geographic diversity checks (evidence from multiple regions)
3. Add temporal diversity (evidence from different time periods)
