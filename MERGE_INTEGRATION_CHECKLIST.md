### Quality Gate Verification

```bash
# Type checking
mypy --strict agents/scoring/rubric_models.py \
                apps/ingestion/crawler.py \
                scripts/compare_esg_analysis.py
# Expected: 0 errors

# Complexity check
lizard agents/scoring/rubric_models.py \
       apps/ingestion/crawler.py \
       scripts/compare_esg_analysis.py
# Expected: CCN <= 10 for all functions

# Documentation check
interrogate -v agents/scoring/rubric_models.py \
               apps/ingestion/crawler.py \
               scripts/compare_esg_analysis.py

## Merge Execution

### Merge Preparation

```bash
# Update master branch
git checkout master
git pull origin master

# Update feature branch
git checkout feature/authenticity-remediation-av-001
git pull origin feature/authenticity-remediation-av-001

# Verify no conflicts
git merge master --no-commit --no-ff
# Should show: "Auto-merging..." or "Already up to date"

git merge --squash feature/authenticity-remediation-av-001

# Create single, clear commit
git commit -m "feat(authenticity): AV-001 Remediation - Phase 1-4 Complete

Reduces violations from 203 to 150 (24.6% reduction)

Phase 1: Add SEED override for deterministic random seeding (26 violations)
Phase 2-3: Add exception logging for silent failures (9 violations)
Phase 4: Add AUDIT_TIME override for datetime determinism (15+ violations)
Phase 5-7: Establish TDD patterns for JSON->Parquet, dict ordering, datetime (documented)

Changes:
- Added to_parquet/from_parquet to MaturityRubric
- Added get_audit_timestamp() helpers with AUDIT_TIME support
- Fixed 5 production files + 3 TDD test suites (63 tests, 100% passing)
- Comprehensive merge readiness documentation

Backward compatible: All env vars optional, new methods additive

## Post-Merge Verification

### Immediate Post-Merge (5-10 minutes)

```bash
# Verify merge was successful
git log master --oneline -5
# Should show new merge commit at top

# Verify feature branch still exists (for archive)
git branch -a | grep authenticity-remediation

# Run quick smoke test
pytest -v tests/test_smoke_cp.py
# Expected: PASS

# Run authenticity audit
python scripts/qa/authenticity_audit.py --out qa
cat qa/report.md | grep "Total Violations"
# Expected: 150
```

**Immediate Verification:**
- [ ] Commit appears in master history
- [ ] Feature branch preserved for reference
- [ ] Smoke tests: PASS
- [ ] Authenticity audit: 150 violations (no regressions)

### Staged Deployment (1-2 hours)

```bash
# Deploy to staging environment
# (varies by deployment process)

# Run full test suite in staging
pytest -v 2>&1 | tee staging_test.log

# Check for regressions
grep "FAILED\|ERROR" staging_test.log
# Expected: 0

# Verify logging
grep -r "SEED=" staging.log | head -5
grep -r "AUDIT_TIME=" staging.log | head -5
# Expected: Environment variables used correctly

# Monitor for errors
tail -f staging_error.log | grep -i "authenticity\|seed\|audit"
# Expected: No authenticity-related errors
```

**Staging Verification:**
- [ ] Full test suite: PASS
- [ ] No regressions detected
- [ ] Environment variables used correctly
- [ ] No error logs related to authenticity changes
- [ ] Performance metrics within expected range

### Production Deployment (Day 1+)

```bash
# Deploy to production
# (varies by deployment process)

# Monitor logs for first 24 hours
for i in {1..10}; do
  echo "=== Check #$i ==="
  # Your log aggregation query here
  # Looking for: SEED, AUDIT_TIME, authenticity errors
  sleep 3600  # Check every hour
done

# Verify metrics
# - Request latency: Should be unchanged or slightly improved (caching)
# - Error rate: Should be <= baseline
# - CPU/Memory: Should be unchanged
```

**Production Monitoring:**
- [ ] No increase in error rates
- [ ] No performance degradation
- [ ] Environment variables optionally configured
- [ ] 24-hour monitoring shows stable operation

## Continuous Integration Updates

### GitHub Actions / CI Pipeline

Add to your CI configuration (.github/workflows/test.yml or similar):

```yaml
# Authenticity Testing
- name: Run Authenticity Tests
  run: |
    export SEED=42
    export PYTHONHASHSEED=0
    export AUDIT_TIME="2025-10-26T21:00:00Z"
    pytest -v -m cp tests/test_*_remediation.py

- name: Run Authenticity Audit
  run: |
    python scripts/qa/authenticity_audit.py --out qa

- name: Check Violations Baseline
  run: |
    VIOLATIONS=$(grep "Total Violations" qa/report.md | grep -o '[0-9]\+' | head -1)
    if [ $VIOLATIONS -gt 150 ]; then
      echo "FAIL: Violations increased to $VIOLATIONS (max: 150)"
      exit 1
    fi
    echo "PASS: Violations at $VIOLATIONS"
```

**CI Updates Needed:**
- [ ] Add SEED=42 to test environment
- [ ] Add PYTHONHASHSEED=0 to test environment
- [ ] Add AUDIT_TIME to test environment (or use UTC now)
- [ ] Add authenticity audit to test pipeline
- [ ] Add baseline check (violations <= 150)
- [ ] Add Phase 1-4 test suites to test matrix

---

## Post-Merge Continuation Plan

### Next Phase: Continue Phase 5-7

**Phase 5: JSON→Parquet (14 more files)**
```bash
# Identify remaining JSON serialization in artifact code
grep -r "to_json(" --include="*.py" agents/ apps/ | grep -v test
# Apply pattern from agents/scoring/rubric_models.py to each
```

**Phase 6: Dict Ordering (9 violations)**
```bash
# Identify dict iteration that's not sorted
grep -r "for .* in .*\.items()" --include="*.py" | grep -v "sorted"
# Apply pattern: for k, v in sorted(dict.items())
```

**Phase 7: Complete Datetime (80+ files)**
```bash
# Apply get_audit_timestamp() pattern to remaining files
grep -r "datetime.now()" --include="*.py" | grep -v "get_audit_timestamp"
# Replace with: get_audit_timestamp() or int(get_audit_timestamp()[:4])
```

**Timeline Estimate:**
- Phase 5: 4-6 hours (14 files × ~20 min each)
- Phase 6: 2-3 hours (9 violations)
- Phase 7: 6-8 hours (80+ files, some bulk replaceable)
- **Total Phase 5-7:** ~14-17 hours (can parallelize)

**Next Merge Target:**
- Create `feature/authenticity-remediation-av-002` branch
- Target: 160 → 100 violations (37.6% reduction)
- Merge when Phase 5-7 tests passing + 10% new test coverage

---

## Rollback Plan

### If Issues Detected Post-Merge

**Option 1: Partial Revert (Recommended)**
```bash
# If only specific files have issues:
git checkout master
git revert --no-commit <merge-commit-sha>

# Restore only affected files
git checkout feature/authenticity-remediation-av-001 -- \
  agents/scoring/rubric_models.py \
  apps/ingestion/crawler.py

git commit -m "fix(authenticity): Revert specific Phase 5-7 changes

Keeping Phase 1-4 changes (stable, well-tested)
Reverting Phase 5-7 changes due to <specific issue>

See MERGE_READINESS.md for details"
```

**Option 2: Complete Revert**
```bash
# If broader issues detected:
git revert -m 1 <merge-commit-sha>

# This creates a new commit that undoes all changes
# Existing code falls back to normal datetime.now() and random.seed()
```

**Option 3: Disable Features (No Code Change)**
```bash
# Simply remove environment variables
unset SEED
unset AUDIT_TIME
unset PYTHONHASHSEED

# Code automatically falls back to original behavior
# No revert needed
```

**Rollback Checklist:**
- [ ] Decision made and approved
- [ ] Rollback executed
- [ ] Tests run post-rollback
- [ ] Monitoring resumed
- [ ] Root cause analysis started
- [ ] Issue logged for investigation
